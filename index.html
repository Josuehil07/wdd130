      I'm Josue Hilario, and I am from Santiago, Dominican Republic. I enjoy running, Dancing, teaching and coding. 
      I am currently studying Web Development at BYU-Idaho, and I am excited to learn more about HTML, CSS, 
      and JavaScript. I hope to use these skills to build beautiful and functional websites in the future.
